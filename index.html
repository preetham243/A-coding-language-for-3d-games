    <h1>Welcome to uniscript's official website!</h1>
    <h4>Uniscript is a DSL scripting language designed for making games and programs easy and fun. Uniscript was coded in python. it was named after the universe, because you can code a game or "universe" in it.</h4>
    <h2>Why choose Uniscript?</h2>
    <p>Uniscript is perfect for beginners and experienced programmers alike. with its easy to learn syntax and built-in 3D game engine(ursina), you can create amazing games and programs in no time. uniscript also makes it simple to fix bugs in your code, so you can focus on creating.</p>
    <h1>Features of Uniscript:</h1>
    <p>-Easy to learn syntax</p>
    <p>-Built-in 3D game engine(ursina)</p>
    <p>simple to fix bugs in code</p>
    <h1>Get started with Uniscript today!</h1>
    <p>To get started with uniscript, download the ursina game engine and python from their official websites. then, you can start coding in uniscript by following this basic template:</p>
    <p>input=draw(tree)+[assign_player+view=first person]+{controls=w,s,a,d}</p>
    <h4>input tells the interpreter what to do,=draw tells to draw, (tree) is the object to draw, [assign_player+view=first person] assigns the player and sets the view to first person, {controls=w,s,a,d} sets the controls for movement.</h4>
    <p>Command 2:</p>
    <p>input=merge(draw(lake)+{forest}+[assign_player+view=first person]+{controls=w,s,a,d})+(input=draw(skyscraper)+[assign_player+view=first person]+{controls=w,s,a,d}))</p>
    <h3>due to merge being a new command, there are only 2 merges</h3>
    <h2>we already know what input= does, but what does merge do? it puts 2 worlds into 1 single world. we learned the other part of the code(draw draws a entity, + extends it, assign_player adds a player, et cetera.)</h2>
    <h1>frequently asked questions:</h1>
    <h3>What is uniscript based on?</h3>
    <p>Uniscript was coded in Python</p>
    <h3>How do i start?</h3>
    <p>Input starts the code, [assign_player] creates a player, {controls=...}control controls</p>
    <h3>What is Uniscript best for?</h3>
    <p>Uniscript is NOT for jobs. it is built for kids and hobbyists. it is best for just fun coding.</p>
    <h1>Fun facts</h1>
    <h3>1:The first version of Uniscript was coded by a 9 year old!</h3>
    <p>You read that right.</p>
    <p>Not a 40 year old, or a 30 year old, or even a 20 year old:</p>
    <p>NINE. YEAR. OLD.</p>
    <h3>2: Uniscript may have never existed if it weren’t for a horror game</h3>
    <p>YES, that’s right. A horror game didn’t scare the founder — instead, it made him imagine God “coding” the universe and having a glitch "coding" us. A weird origin, but completely true!</p>
    <h3>For more information, visit the uniscript github page!</h3>
    <h2>To start, copy the following code, and paste it into a .py file</h2>
    <h4>make sure you have installed ursina and python</h4>
    <h2>the best place to code uniscript is in VScode, as it was first coded there(like this HTML file!)</h2>
